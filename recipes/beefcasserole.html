            <li>Cook your egg noodles or noodles of choice according to the package directions. Drain well, but don't rinse. Add in the packages of cream cheese and sour cream, and mix until well combined.</li>
            <li>Lightly grease a 13- x 9-inch casserole dish, and spread the egg noodle mixture to the bottom.</li>
            <li>Layer with the ground beef mixture.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the Cheddar, Parmesan, and mozzarella cheeses over the top.</li>
            <li>Cover the casserole with foil, and bake as directed for 35 minutes. Bake uncovered for 5 more minutes until the cheese is melted and beginning to turn golden. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
